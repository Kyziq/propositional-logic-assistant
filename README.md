# Propositional Logic Assistant

Propositional logic, also known as sentential logic or Boolean logic, is the branch of logic that studies ways of joining and/or modifying entire propositions, statements or sentences to form more complicated propositions, statements or sentences. It is widely used in Computer Science, Mathematics, Linguistics, and Philosophy among other fields.

The `Propositional Logic Assistant` is a command-line tool developed as part of the CSC510 DISCRETE STRUCTURES course. The tool's primary purpose is to simplify the understanding and application of propositional logic concepts. It offers a hands-on, interactive way for users to practice and grasp various facets of propositional logic, thus serving as a helpful aid for students, educators, and enthusiasts in the respective fields.

## Features
The Propositional Logic Assistant delivers the following functionalities:

1. **Calculator Mode**: In this mode, users can manually input logical propositions, and the tool computes and displays the resulting truth value. It comprehends all basic logic operations, including NOT (¬), AND (∧), OR (∨), IMPLIES (→), and IF AND ONLY IF (⟷).

2. **Quiz Mode**: This mode engages users with a set of questions aimed at testing their understanding of propositional logic. It provides an effective way to apply learned concepts and measure progress.

3. **Truth Tables**: To further aid comprehension, the tool generates truth tables for each logical operation. This visual representation can be instrumental in conceptualizing the results of logical operations.

## Getting Started
To use this tool, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. After confirming the installation, clone this repository to your local machine.

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp` - This file contains the main function which drives the entire program.
- `LogicOperations` - This is a class that encapsulates all the logic operations used in propositional logic.
